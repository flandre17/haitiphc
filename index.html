            <p> <br> Hollers from Haiti #9 – April 21, 2016<br>
Desmond Goodwin ’16</p>
                <p>Two years ago, I traveled to Latournelle for the first time. As I prepared for the trip, I received wise words from a friend who told me that the trip would be a “soul-scrubbing.” I knew that the experience would be extraordinary, but it took me a long time to acknowledge the truth in his words.</p>

<p>Returning from my first trip was difficult. Because the trip is only five days, there is little time for the brain to process and transition, so reentry is challenging. Culture shock is the result of the brain struggling to associate a completely new setting with something that it finds familiar in order to process the “unknown.” Processing can take more time than you would expect. With the trip to St. Marguerite’s, by the time you are only halfway through processing, you are on a plane back to the states. The quick transitions and lack of time to process leaves the brain and body fatigued and overwhelmed. When I returned back home after the trip, the culture shock grew more intense as I continued to unpack my experience. I grappled with cliché philosophical questions about the lack of morality in the world, I struggled with guilt, and I was angry with my peers for not understanding. Most of all I found it hard to focus on the good of the trip: the moments of bliss and laughter, the relationships we built, and the stories we shared. It was ok to feel confused and angry and sad, but to dwell on those feelings alone was a waste of the experience. As I began to truly tell my stories and share moments with friends and family, I came to realize the impact of the trip. I felt the effects of the “soul-scrubbing.”</p>

<p>I told my friends and family that Haiti was all I could think about. In the months following my first time on the mountain, I fell asleep and woke up to images of Haiti. The trip constantly occupied my mind. I longed to be back on the mountain top and underneath the Haitian stars. I spoke of the purity of Haiti. The gratefulness, the joy, the faith. Nothing taken for granted and every small gift praised. Those precious five days rewired my brain, and, as my friend told me, my soul. As I readjusted to home, I found myself weaving the purity of the mountains into my own daily experience: letting the small things I can’t change drift away, allowing time for reflection, and giving thanks for everything that is my life.
</p>
<p>
In the week leading up to the trip this past January, I was anxious. Anxious to see my friends at St. Marguerites and to see the growth of the school, and eager to breathe the mountain air. But most of all I was anxious to get a taste of the purity. The happiest I have been this past year was climbing back up that mountain on January 16th. I felt at peace. I had tapped back into the mindset of Haitian life. I threw my life at St. Mark’s out the window and became entranced with the countryside of Haiti.
                </p>
                <p>The trip was powerful, emotional, fun, challenging, uncomfortable, and rewarding. But every day I dreaded the return because I knew reentry would be difficult. The gossip, the drama, the jammed schedule, the complaining.  It all seemed bizarre and a million miles away. St. Mark’s is the farthest one can get from life in Latournelle and the dramatic transition is extremely difficult to experience. But I knew that I had to return to share and inspire others in order to help the partnership grow.   </p>

<p>When it comes down to it, this partnership is built on the simple concept of friendship. Two people each have something that can help the other, so they share and each grows stronger because of the relationship. In reality, the people of Latournelle are poor. The idea of poverty shouldn’t be romanticized or exacerbated. Poverty is fact. It is a fact that Haiti is a poor country. It is a fact St. Marguerite’s needs help. It is a fact that St. Mark’s has resources to do so. It is also true that the relationship is a partnership and that there is much to be learned on our side of the table. The partnership teaches collaboration on multiple levels.  It teaches mindfulness and how to overcome cultural barriers.  It is centered on the power of human connection and the importance of gratitude. Most importantly, the trip itself offers the gift of a soul-scrubbing. The rewiring, polishing, and cleansing changes your perspective. Changing your perspective changes your attitude. And changing your attitude changes your life. I don’t know when I will return to Haiti, but I know that when I do, my next soul-scrubbing will be long overdue.</p>
